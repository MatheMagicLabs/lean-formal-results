Machine-generated proof, checked by Lean during the experiment.

Theorem:     ModuleCat.depth_eq_top_iff
Source:      Mathlib @ a02a63c2, Mathlib/RingTheory/Depth/Basic.lean, line 96
             (new in Mathlib since d0a050ad6, i.e. after the models' training data)
Experiment:  O4-layer-with-search, arm RT, verified in round 1 (round 0 = first attempt)
Prover:      claude-opus-5-5
Setup:       Opus 5.5 with repair loop, lemma layer and name search (arm RT)
Check:       the proof replaced the human proof in the Mathlib file above; Lean reported
             0 errors and no `sorry`; sorry/admit/native_decide/search tactics were rejected.
