Machine-generated proof, checked by Lean during the experiment.

Theorem:     MinTropical.add_eq_iff
Source:      Mathlib @ d0a050ad6, Mathlib/Algebra/Tropical/Basic.lean, line 359 (group STABLE)
Experiment:  UE1-deepseek-8-samples, arm sample 0, single attempt
Prover:      DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B (4-bit)
Setup:       DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B (4-bit, local), 8 independent samples per theorem, no Lean feedback;
             160 theorems: 80 DRIFT (human proof cites a lemma added after the 2025-05 snapshot) and 80 STABLE
Check:       the proof replaced the human proof in the Mathlib file above; Lean reported
             0 errors and no `sorry`.
