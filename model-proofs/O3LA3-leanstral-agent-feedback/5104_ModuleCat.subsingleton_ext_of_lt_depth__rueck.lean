Machine-generated proof, checked by Lean during the experiment.

Theorem:     ModuleCat.subsingleton_ext_of_lt_depth
Source:      Mathlib @ a02a63c2, Mathlib/RingTheory/Depth/Basic.lean, line 136
             (new in Mathlib since d0a050ad6, i.e. after the models' training data)
Experiment:  O3LA3-leanstral-agent-feedback, arm rueck, verified in final
Prover:      labs-leanstral-1-5
Setup:       Leanstral 1.5 agent with goal-state feedback (arm rueck)
Check:       the proof replaced the human proof in the Mathlib file above; Lean reported
             0 errors and no `sorry`; sorry/admit/native_decide/search tactics were rejected.
