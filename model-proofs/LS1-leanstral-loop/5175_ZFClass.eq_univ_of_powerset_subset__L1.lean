Machine-generated proof, checked by Lean during the experiment.

Theorem:     ZFClass.eq_univ_of_powerset_subset
Source:      Mathlib @ a02a63c2, Mathlib/SetTheory/ZFC/Class.lean, line 152
             (new in Mathlib since d0a050ad6, i.e. after the models' training data)
Experiment:  LS1-leanstral-loop, arm L1, verified in round 2 (round 0 = first attempt)
Prover:      labs-leanstral-1-5
Setup:       Leanstral 1.5 in a fixed check-and-repair loop: L1 = 1 candidate per round, L3 = up to 3
Check:       the proof replaced the human proof in the Mathlib file above; Lean reported
             0 errors and no `sorry`; sorry/admit/native_decide/search tactics were rejected.
