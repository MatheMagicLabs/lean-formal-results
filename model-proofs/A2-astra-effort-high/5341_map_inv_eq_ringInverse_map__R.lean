Machine-generated proof, checked by Lean during the experiment.

Theorem:     map_inv_eq_ringInverse_map
Source:      Mathlib @ a02a63c2, Mathlib/Algebra/GroupWithZero/Units/Lemmas.lean, line 72
             (new in Mathlib since d0a050ad6, i.e. after the models' training data)
Experiment:  A2-astra-effort-high, arm R, verified in round 2 (round 0 = first attempt)
Prover:      gpt-6-astra
Setup:       GPT-6 Astra, reasoning effort high (arms R, N0)
Check:       the proof replaced the human proof in the Mathlib file above; Lean reported
             0 errors and no `sorry`; sorry/admit/native_decide/search tactics were rejected.
