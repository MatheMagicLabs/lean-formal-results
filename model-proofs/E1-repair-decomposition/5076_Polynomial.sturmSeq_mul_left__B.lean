Machine-generated proof, checked by Lean during the experiment.

Theorem:     Polynomial.sturmSeq_mul_left
Source:      Mathlib @ a02a63c2, Mathlib/Algebra/Polynomial/Sturm/Sequence.lean, line 139
             (new in Mathlib since d0a050ad6, i.e. after the models' training data)
Experiment:  E1-repair-decomposition, arm B, verified in round 1 (round 0 = first attempt)
Prover:      gpt-6-astra
Setup:       GPT-6 Astra, which part of Lean feedback makes repair work: after a shared first attempt (E0), V = full error messages, Z = line numbers only, B = only "Lean rejected this proof"
Check:       the proof replaced the human proof in the Mathlib file above; Lean reported
             0 errors and no `sorry`; sorry/admit/native_decide/search tactics were rejected.
